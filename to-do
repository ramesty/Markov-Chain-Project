I want to finish more or less the frontend
    - reorganize so that left has navbar, and matrices on the right
    - matrices component should take up the width of the parent
    - add a button to a navbar

Button should trigger a hook that calls the backend

Backend call should return three json objects, they should be displayed on the frontend
    - want a transition Probability matrix
    - stead state distribution vector
    - random markov walk

Once this is complete, we will need to create a frontend image and a backend image
and ensure communication between running containers

Once I have communicating containers, I can look to deploy onto the cloud

Frontend â†” Backend
Your Vite app will make HTTP requests to the backend (e.g., https://api.example.com/data)
They can live on different services as long as the backend allows cross-origin requests (CORS headers)

Frontend
Should make the matrix empty initially, not sure if I should start with empty matrix and vector values.
When we recieve a response from the server, we rerender using useeffect I believe. 
Also need to figure out a colour scheme that I like.
Need to pass in my transition matrix as a prop, as well as the steady state vector
Lastly, add custom tailwind classes so that the classes are not so long
