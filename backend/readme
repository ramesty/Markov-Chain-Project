How to run:
Backend:
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
to test api endpoints after running: http://localhost:8000/docs#/

Work I just did:
- created a context called DataProvider that will be used by all my components
- created a custom hook that uses this context and throughs an error if it is not there
- created types that I need for my context (API response, my DataCOntext type)

Need to be able to send and receive data, merge these changes into the actual components
that are calling them. Right now we created a dummy page
